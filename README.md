# MiniSub
MiniSub is a project to learn about embedded systems development in a challenging underwater environment. It is built using [ROS2](https://www.ros.org/) and [MicroROS](https://micro.ros.org/).

## Project status
The project is currently in a "feasability research" phase, where I'm just building a simple test device.

## Project goals
* To design an open source autonomous underwater vehicle using affordable, off-the-shelf and 3d printed components which is able to dive at least 50 meters deep. 
* To learn about using ROS to operate the various systems required to run the vehicle (autonomously).
* To learn about embedded development by implementing a custom MicroROS node to run all vehicle controls and telemetry.
* To learn about machine learning and computer vision using depth cameras to scan the sea/river/lakebed.
