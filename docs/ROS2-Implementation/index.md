# MiniSub & ROS2

MiniSub is controlled through ROS2. Being an underwater robot, MiniSub can rely on the ROS ecosystem to provide professional control interfaces and other required software components. 

## ROS Packages
We aim to only use ROS packages which are available as prebuilt packages, either using `.deb` packages on linux, or using `conda` packages on Windows and MacOS. More on setting up the MiniSub ROS workspace can be found on the [setup page](setup.md).
